    This is a modern theme in clean white and blue. The layout is adjusted as much as possible for use on touch devices like tablets and mobile phones. The menu is responsive. This means it will collapse on smaller screens and have only clickable items. You might be used to hover over a menu item to get it’s submenu but on touch devices the hover functionality doesn’t exist. The tabs at the individual page are replaced by bootstrap panels for a better layout on mobile devices. Also the sidebar will collapse automatically when viewing from smaller screens.

    There is also a [JustLight Theme options](https://github.com/JustCarmen/justlight_theme_options) module which customises the JustLight theme and provides more features.

    The Rural theme is mainly based on brown tones, as a tribute to the earth our ancestors used to cultivate, with some green, color of nature. A companion of webtrees for over a decade now, its characteric layout is still organised around the main genealogical content being wrapped within a responsive white panel on a brown background.

    The header image can be customised, by replacing the file `./modules_v4/myartjaub_ruraltheme/resources/images/header.png` by a personal one. There is only a constraint on the height which cannot exceed **150px**.
