This module shows the individuals/families collected in CCE in a node-link force-directed diagram generated using D3.js. Families are presented as circles, children of a family are person nodes arranged in them. The diameter of a family circle corresponds to the range of the birth dates of the people included - the further apart they are, the larger the circle. The date is derived from the original Gedcom. The analysis is simpler/stricter than in Webtrees Core, oversized circle diameters are an indication of ambiguous dates. In this respect, TAM can be used as an analysis tool for aspects of data quality.
TAM stands for 'Topographic Attribute Map', the color values ​​of the person nodes correspond to a color gradient across the people included in the view. The entire view can be underlaid with a quasi-topographic map, the contour lines in it correspond to annual values. The view can be exported as an independent HTML. A current state can be saved, and saved states can also be read again.

Note: This module only works as an extension to CCE. It is not intended to be called independently.
