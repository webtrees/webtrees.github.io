The analysis is simpler/stricter than in Webtrees Core, oversized circle diameters are an indication of ambiguous dates. In this respect, TAM can be used as an analysis tool for aspects of data quality.
TAM stands for 'Topographic Attribute Map', the color values ​​of the person nodes correspond to a color gradient across the people included in the view.
