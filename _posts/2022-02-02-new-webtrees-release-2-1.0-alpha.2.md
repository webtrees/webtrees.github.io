webtrees 2.1.0-alpha.2 is now available for download.

This version now has full support for PHP 8.1.

The `alpha` status indicates that the internal structure of the code will change
before the final `2.1.0` release.  Module developers are reminded to check for `@deprecated`
comments in the code, and avoid using these classes and functions.

See the [change log](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/compare/2.1.0-alpha.1...2.1.0-alpha.2) for details.
