## How do I enable pretty URLs?

Default URLs look like: `https://example.com/index.php?route=/tree/demo`.

Pretty URLs look like: `https://example.com/tree/demo`.

To enable "pretty URLs", you need two things.

Firstly, you must configure your web-server to accept pretty URLs,
and forward them to webtrees.  The exact configuration will be
different for every server.  The basic setup is:

* Static files are kept in `/public`.
These can be served directly, using long expires headers.

* Dynamic pages are generated by `index.php`.
All non-static URLs should be mapped onto `/index.php`.

* Other files and folders are private, and should not be made
available.
e.g. `/app`, `/data`, `/modules`, `/resources`, `/vendor`.

Secondly, you must tell webtrees to generate pretty URLs.
You do this by adding/changing two lines in the file `data/config.ini.php`.

```
base_url="https://www.example.com/webtrees"
rewrite_urls="1"
```

After you enable pretty URLs, webtrees still recognise the default URLs.
So any bookmarks and search-engine links will still work.

## Recognising URLs from webtrees 1.x and phpGedView

webtrees is able to recognise the URLs generated by these older applications.
So bookmarks and search engine links to `{base_url}/individual.php?pid=XXX&ged=YYY`
will be automatically forwarded to `{base_url}/tree/YYY/individual/XXX`.

Note that this will not work for **relative** URLs that you may have embedded
in HTML blocks on your home pages.  e.g. `<a href="individual.php">...</a>`.
You will need to edit these manually.

## Example configuration for NGINX ##

Here is an example NGINX configuration for webtrees installed in a subfolder `/webtrees/`.

```
# Static files have versions in their URLs, and can be cached indefinitely.
location /webtrees/public {
    expires 365d;
    access_log off;
}

# GIT config files can contain credentials or other sensitive data.
location /webtrees/.git {
    deny all;
}

# User data is stored here by default.
location /webtrees/data {
    deny all;
}

# Nothing sensitive here, but there is no need to publish it.
location /webtrees/app {
    deny all;
}
location /webtrees/modules {
    deny all;
}
location /webtrees/resources {
    deny all;
}
location /webtrees/vendor {
    deny all;
}

# Rewrite all other requests onto the webtrees front-controller.
location /webtrees/ {
    rewrite ^ /webtrees/index.php last;
}

# webtrees runs from this one script.
location = /webtrees/index.php {
    include fastcgi.conf;
    fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;
}
```

## Example configuration for Apache ##

Does your server support `.htaccess` files?  To test this, try to view
your webtrees configuration file in your browser (e.g. `https://<your.site.com>/data/config.ini.php`).  If `.htaccess`
files are supported, you will get 403/Access-denied error.  If not, you
will see a page containing just a semicolon.

Store the following `.htaccess` file in the webtrees folder.

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /webtrees/
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

Change the entry for `RewriteBase` to match the folder part of your
webtrees URL.
